# Random-Forest-Machine-Learning
Using random forest machine learning to predict plant geography and carbon fluxes

In the project datasets, you will find the following files:

(1) Climate datasets:

a: Predaymean1961_1990.csv, Tswrfdaymean1961_1990.csv, Tmaxdaymean1961_1990.csv, Tmindaymean1961_1990, Tmpdaymean1961_1990.csv (these variables are calculated as the multi-year average for a yearly basis (365days). 

b: Predaymean1961-1990_statics.csv,  Tswrfdaymean1961_1990_statics.csv, Tmaxdaymean1961_1990_statics.csv, Tmindaymean1961_1990_statics, Tmpdaymean1961_1990_statics.csv (these variables are calculated as mean, median and standard deviation of four seasons from "a" group datasets.  

(2) other datasets:

c. soilmap_center_interpolated.dat (soil texture datasets)

d. gridlist_pan_gfed_ISO3_UN.txt  (the country and continent codes)

e. LPJ-GUESS_output_BERN1.csv (LPJ GUESS outputs and the observed biomes)

f. example datasets (data_index-example.csv and data_index_2.csv)

g. scripts: Biome.py.ipynb for plotting the biome map using "the legend of biomes.txt" 

For your self-learning to be familiar with machine learning, you can first look at the script BERN01Demo.ipynb.
